## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Using the CSS Grid and Flexbox to create a responsive layout was a great learning experience. I also learned how to use the CSS variables to make the code more readable and reusable. Using the background-image property to add a background image to the card was also a great learning experience. 

```css
body{
      background-color: var(--clr-primary-400);
      background-image: url(./images/pattern-background-mobile.svg);
      background-repeat: no-repeat;
      background-size: contain;
}
```
